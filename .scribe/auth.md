# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_API_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by visiting your API dashboard and clicking <b>Generate Token</b>.
